    "In this notebook we will introduce and talk about functions. Functions are extremely useful concepts where you can bundle a set of instructions that you can use repeatedly or want to have self contained as a sub-program to be called when necessary. Think of it as a blackbox that does something for you when call it. To perform the task, the blackbox might or might not need inputs that you need to supply and it might or might not return a value. \n",

The def statement will always end with a colon (:) as shown in red. There may or may not be parameters of a function. The parameters hold the inputs (arguments) you send to the function and inside the function as shown in orenge, you will work on these parameters to perform your task and produce the result.
